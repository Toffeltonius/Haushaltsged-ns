# Welcome to Public Budgeting

In this Project we worked through the complex hierarchy of public budgets of five federal states in germany and made them accessible to the general public. 

Here is a quick chronological overview:

1. Manually augment and upload the data provided by the federal states for the year 2022 with Python.
2. Create a relational database with PostgreSQL, DBeaver and Amazon AWS.
3. Partially automate the process with Python of augmenting and uploading to speed up the process for more data to come.
4. Visualize the data with Tableau and provide an interactive Dashboard.
